--- currently working on
. Add different death flavour text to different enemies


==========================


--- short term
. Make item class
. Add inventory


--- mid term
. Make lootTables for mobs and locations


--- long term
. Implement foraging mechanic dependent on luck
. Add random combat encounters when foraging in hostile locations
. Polish hunting experience
. Make dmg in combat random but still dependent on strength


==========================


--- ideas
. Put all objects of classes into separate files for ease
. Make an ambushing mechanic dependent on luck to get first turn


--- not likely
. Have a pause between inputs so as to not  confuse the player with too much text at once
. Add ascii map that player can view with a command
. Make stats and actions scalable to allow for addition of new ones later
. Display both the player actions and actions appropriate for the location
